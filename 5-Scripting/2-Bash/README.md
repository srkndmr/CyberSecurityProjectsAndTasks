# Bash Scripting

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a powerful scripting language and command interpreter widely used for system administration, automation, and text processing. This README provides an overview of Bash scripting fundamentals, features, and best practices.

## What is Bash?

Bash is:
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Execute commands interactively in a terminal.
- **Scripting Language**: Automate repetitive tasks using scripts.

Bash scripts are plain text files containing sequences of commands.

---

## Why Use Bash?

1. **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks, such as backups, monitoring, and file management.
2. **System Administration**: Manage files, users, and processes efficiently.
3. **Integration**: Combine commands, programs, and utilities into a single workflow.
4. **Cross-Platform**: Runs on most Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, WSL on Windows).

## Basic Bash Script Structure

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This is a comment
echo "Hello, World!"  # Print a message
```

### Explanation:
- `#!/bin/bash`: Shebang line specifying the interpreter.
- `#`: Comments ignored by Bash.
- `echo`: Built-in command to display text.

## Key Features of Bash

### Variables
```bash
name="John"
echo "Hello, $name"
```

### Conditional Statements
```bash
if [ -f "file.txt" ]; then
  echo "File exists."
else
  echo "File does not exist."
fi
```

### Loops
```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Count: $i"
done
```

### Functions
```bash
greet() {
  echo "Hello, $1!"
}
greet "Alice"
```

## Running a Bash Script

1. **Create a Script**:
   Save the file with a `.sh` extension, e.g., `script.sh`.

2. **Make it Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   ./script.sh
   ```

---

## Debugging Bash Scripts

Enable debugging with the `-x` flag:
```bash
bash -x script.sh
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use Comments**: Explain complex code with comments.
2. **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully using `if`, `||`, `&&`, or `trap`.
3. **Test Scripts**: Test scripts in a safe environment before deploying.
4. **Use Meaningful Names**: For variables and functions.
5. **Validate Input**: Check user input with conditions to prevent errors.
