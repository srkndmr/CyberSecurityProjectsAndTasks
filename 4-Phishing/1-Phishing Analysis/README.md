🕵️‍♂️ Phishing Analysis Challenge: SOC-it to 'Em!
🕒 The Setup
You’re a fearless SOC analyst, armed with curiosity, caffeine, and a handful of sketchy .eml files from your “helpful” colleagues. Your mission? Sort out the real emails from the phishing ones before Karen in HR sends her life savings to a Nigerian prince. 📨

🎯 Challenge Details
Type: Learning (because mistakes happen, but let’s try not to.)
Duration: 2 Days (or 5 if procrastination strikes.)
Team Challenge: Solo (because teamwork makes the dream work...unless it’s phishing.)

Your Mission:
Analyze 5 emails, identify phishing attempts, and write a report with screenshots. Save the company, become the office hero, and maybe even earn a free coffee.

🔍 Key Questions to Answer:
What’s the email timestamp? (Was the scammer working overtime?)
Who sent it? (Is "Bill from IT Support" even real?)
What’s their email address? (spoofed.email@definitelynotlegit.com?)
Where do replies go? (The prince’s offshore account?)
What brand are they impersonating? (Hope it’s not one you shop at!)
What’s the originating IP? (Defang it, or it might bite.)
Suspicious domain? (Defang that too – safety first!)
What’s the shortened URL? (Not all tiny URLs are cute.)
Phishing email? (Spoiler alert: Probably yes.)

Run the Tools: Let VirusTotal and friends do the heavy lifting.
Take Screenshots: Pics or it didn’t happen.
