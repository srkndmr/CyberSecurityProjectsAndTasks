Technical Analysis
SPF (Sender Policy Framework):
* Originating IP analysis actions: Pass
* Result: Pass
* Originating IP: 66.211.170.87 (Received-SPF)
* rDNS: mx1.phx.paypal.com
* Return-Path domain: paypal.be
* SPF record: v=spf1 mx include:pp._spf.paypal.com include:3rdparty._spf.paypal.com include:3rdparty1._spf.paypal.com include:3rdparty2._spf.paypal.com ~all
* Explanation: SPF is an email authentication method that verifies whether an email comes from a trusted server 
authorized by the domain's administrators. It helps prevent spoofing by validating the sender's IP address against 
the domain's published SPF record.
DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):
* DKIM analysis actions: Error
* Result: Neutral
* Verification(s): 1 Signature - 1 NEUTRAL
* Selector: pp-dkim1._domainkey.paypal.be (Signature 1 of 1)
* Signing domain: paypal.be 
* Algorithm: rsa-sha256
* Verification: NEUTRAL
* Explanation: DKIM adds a digital signature to an email, ensuring the message has not been altered in transit. 
The signature is validated against a public key published in the DNS, confirming the authenticity of the sending 
domain.

* DMARC analysis actions: Pass
* Result: Pass
* From domain: paypal.be
* DMARC record: v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:d@rua.agari.com; ruf=mailto:d@ruf.agari.com
* Explanation: DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM to provide instructions to receiving mail servers on handling failed 
authentication. It also enables domain owners to receive reports about email authentication activity to prevent 
misuse of their domain.
