# Simple Network Build 🌐
Welcome to Simple Network Build, where we keep things... well, simple! This is the project where I take the basics of networking and make them do fancy things — like connecting devices and (hopefully) not crashing them.

## What’s Inside?
Router and Switch Magic: Connecting routers and switches like a pro (or at least, trying to).
IP Address Shenanigans: Assigning IPs, because every device deserves its own little piece of the internet.
Device Drama: PCs, laptops, and a few other devices in a network dance-off. Let’s hope they play nice.
## Why Go Simple?
Because when it comes to networks, simpler is often better. And if it looks simple, then you know some serious troubleshooting was probably involved.

## Got Questions?
If you’ve got questions, feedback, or tips on keeping network setups drama-free, feel free to reach out. Happy networking! 🤓🌐
